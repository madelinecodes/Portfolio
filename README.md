# My Portfolio

I used a Gatsby/React starter for my portfolio.

There's a Netlify webhook setup and changes are deployed live to https://madeline.codes/

## Installation

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
`gatsby new gatsby-starter-strata https://github.com/ChangoMan/gatsby-starter-strata`

Run `gatsby develop` in the terminal to start.
